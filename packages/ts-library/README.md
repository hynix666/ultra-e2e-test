# ts-library

A TypeScript library published to npm: an ES module with its own type declarations, a single entry in the `exports` map, and checks that the published package works as consumers will install it. The example code is the task status rules the services enforce, for clients that want to offer only moves the API accepts.

```ts
import { canTransition, nextStatuses, parseStatus } from "@hynix666/ultra-e2e-test";

nextStatuses(parseStatus(response.status)); // ["todo", "done"] for "in_progress"
```

## Check

```bash
npm install
npm run verify   # typecheck, tests, build, and the package checks below
```

- **`tsc`** type-checks sources and tests.
- **Tests** run the TypeScript sources directly under Node 24.
- **`npm run build`** emits `dist/` from `src/` only, with `isolatedDeclarations`: every export states its type, so declarations never depend on inference.
- **`publint --strict`** checks the package's `exports`, `files` and entry points.
- **`attw --pack`** checks, against the tarball `npm pack` would publish, that the types resolve the way TypeScript consumers will resolve them.

## Publish

With the `release` feature, a merged release pull request publishes this package to npm at the release's version, with [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements). No token is stored: npm trusts the workflow through OpenID Connect.

1. On npmjs.com, add a trusted publisher to the package: GitHub Actions, this repository, workflow `release.yml`. If npm does not accept a trusted publisher for a package that has never been published, publish the first version once by hand with `npm publish --access public`.
2. Set the repository variable `NPM_PUBLISH_ENABLED=true`.

npm scopes are lowercase. If your GitHub owner name has capitals, change `name` in `package.json` before the first release.
