description: Bring changes from a newer ultra-e2e-test release into this project — fixes to the checks, workflows, services or docs it was generated with. Use when asked to update from the template, or when a template release note describes a fix this project needs.

# Update from the template

This project was generated from ultra-e2e-test and keeps none of its history, so template changes cannot be merged directly. `scripts/template-update.mjs` recomputes them instead: it generates this project as the release it came from and as the newer release would, and applies the difference with a three-way merge.

1. **Find where the project stands.** `CHANGELOG.md` has an `Initialized from` line, and an `Updated to` line for each update since; the highest version is the current one. Read the template's release notes from that version to the one you are moving to, and say in one line what the update brings. Updates only move forward; the script refuses a release older than the current one.
2. **Start clean.** Commit or stash everything first; the script refuses a dirty working tree so the update can be reviewed and undone on its own. Work on a branch.
3. **Look first.** `node scripts/template-update.mjs --to vX.Y.Z --dry-run` lists every file that would change. Files the project deleted are skipped and named.
4. **Apply.** `node scripts/template-update.mjs --to vX.Y.Z`. Exit 0 applied cleanly, 1 applied with conflicts, 2 could not run. The owner and repository come from the `origin` remote; pass `--owner` and `--repo` if there is none.
5. **Resolve conflicts as a merge, not a choice of side.** A conflict means the project and the template both changed the same lines. Keep the project's intent and the template's fix; if you cannot tell what the template's change is for, read its pull request before deciding.
6. **Prove it.** `node scripts/setup.mjs`, then `node scripts/verify.mjs`. A template update can change checks as well as code, so a check that now fails may have found something real in this project — fix that rather than reverting the check.
7. **Land it as its own pull request**, titled `chore: update from ultra-e2e-test vX.Y.Z`, with the release notes linked. The script has already added the `Updated to` line to `CHANGELOG.md`; keep it, because the next update starts from there.

Skip a release only by moving to a later one: updates are cumulative, and the script computes the whole difference between any two releases.
