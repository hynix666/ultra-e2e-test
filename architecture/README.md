# architecture

The system's architecture as code, in [LikeC4](https://likec4.dev). Diagrams are views of one model, so they cannot drift apart from each other, and the model is checked in CI like any other source.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # live preview of every view
npm run verify     # validate the model, run the model rules, build the static site
```

- `model/spec.c4` — the element kinds this model may use.
- `model/system.c4` — the system: people, services, web apps, and how they depend on each other.
- `model/views.c4` — the diagrams.
- `rules.mjs` — rules the model must satisfy, such as "every service states its technology" and "no service depends on a web app"; `test/model.test.mjs` runs them against the model and proves each one can fail.

Change the model in the same pull request as the structure it describes. To publish it, enable GitHub Pages with the *GitHub Actions* source and set the repository variable `PAGES_ENABLED=true`; `.github/workflows/architecture.yml` then deploys it on every push to `main`.

The VS Code extension `likec4.likec4-vscode` adds completion, navigation and previews.
